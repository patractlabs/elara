# elara
Elara is inspired by [Infura](https://infura.io/) from the Ethereum ecosystem. Elara aims to provide RPC interface services for the relay chain and parachains in the Polkadot network. Parachain and contract developers from the Polkadot ecosystem will be able to integrate Elara as the backend, saving the trouble of building and operating multi blockchain nodes by themselves. Elara will provide a unified API, SDK, library and other interfaces for multiple blockchains, allowing users to perform simple programming, debugging, and lower barriers to use directly in the web browser.
